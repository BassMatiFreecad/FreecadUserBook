# The Freecad User Book
Resources for learning and using FreeCAD

Motivation

Currently I am a Freecad learner, and I want to organize and document my learning curve so that others can participate, and find answers to their questions, as well as ask new ones.

The form I have chosen is the a mixture of information and step-by-step tutorials. They are generally rather detailed and fine-grained, so that a Freecad newbie should be able to follow. A lot of screenshots illustrate the instructions so the reader has a lot of feedback whether he is on the right track. An expert should have no problem to quickly scan through the instructions and find the relevant information.

Some topics are supported by additional video footage, hosted on Youtube. This material tends to be more condensed, and may not provide the in-depth information found in the text.


Status

This is a work in progress,  There certainly is more to come, but I can't tell exactly when. Perhaps I should rename the title to "Part Design with Freecad Assembly 3"...


How to use this book

To open the book, navigate the to root folder, and open the index.htm page https://bassmatifreecad.github.io/FreecadUserBook/index.htm. Click on the link that matches your preferred language. This takes you to the table of contents page of the book in that language. Use the navigation features from there on. Home, back, forward and table-of-contents links on a sticky panel at the top of the page allow you to access the entire content. 

As an alternative, you can download the entire book and open the index.htm file(s) in a browser that supports file:// system urls. Then you have everything is offline, except for the video content, which is (currently) hosted on Youtube. The table-of-contents system might require a local web server like NodeJS httpserver.


Translations and Contribution

I doubt that I will find the time to create and maintain a German translation. Therefore, contributors are welcome to carry out this task, add translations for other languages, and provide additional content on Freecad topics I am currently not so familiar with.


Corrections, Suggestions

I am not perfect. If you find typos, something wrong or have suggestions, you can create an issue, or post to the Freecad forum (which has to be created yet).


A Final Word

Well... have an nice journey, and enjoy!
