# The Freecad User Book
Resources for learning and using FreeCAD

Motivation

Currently I am a Freecad learner, but I want to organize and document my learning curve so that others can participate and find answers to their questions.

The form I have chosen is the a mixture of information and step-by-step tutorials. These are in general very detailed and fine-grained so that a Freecad newbie should be able to follow. An expert should have no problem to quickly scan through the instructions and find the relevant information.

Some topics are supported by additional video footage. This material is more condensed and does not provide the in-depth information found in the text.
 

Status

This is a work in progress, so please don't complain about only four pages on a very specific subject of Freecad at the beginnig. There certainly is more to come, but I can't tell exactly when.


Why I don't want to write a WIKI

1 - The pages created in the "e-book" here will eventually form a complex tree structure, and the tree structure is expected to change very much over time. The structure is implemented in the "table-of-contents.htm" files in a central location.

2 - The table of contents is loaded and used on all pages to provide consisten and complete navigation features. I cannot maintain individual navigation code on every page. This inevitable leads to inaccessible pages or errors in the back-and-forth link chain.

3 - Markdown code only allows access to a subset of HTML, which is not enough for the complexity of this e-book.

4 - JavaScript is used to support the user interface to a large extent. I'm not sure whether JS can be used to automate WIKI pages, and what the limitations are.

5 - Small Devices
The content should be easily readable on small devices (smartphones etc.) or narrow browser windows. This requires that the content automatically fills the available width, and flows down as required. Something like a "responsive layout". As a benefit, you can arrange the web browser in a small strip side-by-side with the Freecad window, and still read comfortably.


Why I should perhaps write a WIKI

There is currently no book-wide search function in the script code. Currently the search functions of the host system (Github, computer's operating system) must be used. This could be a problem on mobile devices with operating systems such as Android, iOS or Windows Phone (in alphabetic order).


How to use this book

The book is written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To open it, navigate the to root folder, and open the index.htm page. Click on the link that matches your preferred language. This takes you to the table of contents page of the book in that language. Use the navigation features from there on.

As an alternative, you can download the book and load the index.htm file(s) in your browser. Then everything is offline, except for the video content, which are (currently) hosted on Youtube.


Translations and Contribution

I doubt that I will find the time to create and maintain a German translation. Therefor, contributors are wellcome to carry out this task, add translations for other languages, and provide additional content on Freecad topics I am currently not so familiar with.


Corrections, Suggestions

I am not perfect. If you find typos, something wrong or have suggestions, you can create an issue, or post to the Freecad forum (which has to be created yet).


A Final Word

Well... have an nice journey, and enjoy!
