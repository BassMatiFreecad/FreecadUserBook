	<li><a href="asm3/arch.htm">Architecture</a><abstract>Knowing the ideas behind the design and architecture of the <tt>Assembly 3</tt> provides the key for understanding the benefits of the Assembly 3 workbench.</abstract></li>
	<li><a href="asm3/asm.htm">Workflow</a><abstract>Let's summarize the walkthrough tutorial of the previous chapter, and extract some rules for clean workflows in Assembly 3.</abstract></li>
	<li><a href="asm3/visual-aids.htm">Visual Aids</a><abstract>The visibility and color of <tt>Constraint Connectors</tt> can be controlled by settings and properties. This tutorial demonstrates them and gives hints how to integrate them into your workflow.</abstract></li>
	<li><a href="asm3/move.htm">Moving Objects</a><abstract>If the level of nested subassemblies exceeds 1, the mover tools don't work as expected. Instead of moving just the part, sometimes the whole assembly moves. There is a certain set of rules behind, but they are not easy to spot on first sight.</abstract></li>
	<li>Mating Components With Constraints</li>
	<li><a href="asm3/link.htm">Link and Link Array</a><abstract>The <tt>Link</tt> object is a very versatile element for using multiple instances of a component. Instead of copy/paste multiplication, the <tt>Link</tt> represents the link source object, without duplicating its definition. And the <tt>Link</tt> comes with an extra benefit: It works across file borders!</abstract></li>
	<li><a href="asm3/xrepo.htm">Repository Concepts</a><abstract>The <tt>Link</tt> object allows to build repositories for re-usable components. This tutorial illustrates the use of local (inside the project file) and external repositories (in external files), and the indirection layer for components in a local repository.</abstract></li>

			<abstract>This exercise describes how to create a cube that sits in one of its corner, with the opposite corner vertically above the other, similar to those chocolate cubes hanging on a Christmas tree.<br />The trick is to begin with a cube in a specific orientation, with the vertical edges on the XZ and YZ planes. Then rotate the thing about the y axis until two opposite corners come to rest exactly on the z axis.<br />The exact rotation angle is determined with a geometry sketch. A detailed algebraic analysis confirms the graphical result.</abstract></li>
